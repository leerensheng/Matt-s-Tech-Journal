Though I've already been coding for, well, a better part of a decade, I've had a lot of false starts and stops. I'll record my thoughts here on my way to creating a full-stack web app.

My ultimate goal is to build the backend using Python/Django and the frontend with javascript/React. For the styling, I'll use Tailwind CSS. If I get all of that done, I'll package it up as a mobile app using React Native. 

I'll host it on AWS yet keep it turned off, more for the learning aspect of how to use the various tools, since I doubt that the app will ever need to use all of the AWS tools...I'm not building Instagram, though I'd like to be able to scale an app to handle that kind of traffic.

Cheers to recording what I'm actually doing!
